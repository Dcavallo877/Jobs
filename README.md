# Jobs
A small repository to track changes to code and demonstrate basic Git workflow.

## Purpose

Track code changes, keep a clean history, and push changes to a remote repository.

## Quickstart

Run these commands in the repository root to work with the project:

```bash
git status
git add <files>
git commit -m "Describe changes"
git push
```

## Notes

- This repo is already a git repository and appears connected to a remote named `origin`.
- A `.gitignore` has been added to exclude common files and directories.

If you want, I can create a remote GitHub repository and push the code there (requires `gh` authentication).
